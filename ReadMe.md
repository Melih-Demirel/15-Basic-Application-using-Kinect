# Kinect Project

### Demo: [Watch the demo](https://youtu.be/Krv7BGq6h_s)

### App:

    The app has two windows. One is for showing the skeleton (like in the examples), and the other one is the calibration window that I made. Before calibrating, I initially utilize the primary window to assess the Kinect camera's detection range, observing how far and wide it can detect an individual. During this process, we strategically position four objects to form a rectangular perimeter, outlining the camera's field of view. With this setup complete, we transition to the calibration window, where four corners are designated. Your task is to locate the corner highlighted in green and wave either your left or right arm, which initiates the calibration process for that specific point. Once calibrated, a square marker will be positioned beneath the individual, tracking their movements accurately.
